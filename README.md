# elm-fluxus

This project is the trying to implement [fluxus API](http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/) (and may be the editor itself, later) in Elm and WebGL.

[A video in action](https://vimeo.com/202176855) at Vimeo.

:warning: :cop: :zap: :exclamation: :collision: :no_good: Work in progress, even the `master` branch could fail to work for now.

The first and the latest kinda-stable, yet experimental version, with working examples is [tagged `v0.1.0`](https://github.com/shamansir/elm-fluxus/releases/tag/v0.1.0) _(and it is the version used in video)_.
